This repository contains projects that I have pursued on my own volition and self interest.

# Project 1: Exploratory Analysis, Web Scraping and Visualization of Formula 1 2022 Qualifying Data  

NOTE: As the current season is still ongoing, this project is valid up until the Canadian Grand Prix.  
This project has three points of interest: 

1.) I determine whether drivers tend to perform better in qualifying at specific tracks.  
2.) I assess the skill level of drivers compared to their teammates by determining their head to head in qualifying and I also use findings from the first point of interest (if applicable i.e. track bias exists in qualifying) to assess the skill level of drivers.  
3.) I determine the average changes in qualifying session times for each team.  
  
## Methodology  
1.) The dataset is sourced from this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anandaramg/f1-champ-eda-classification-100-accuracy/data?select=circuits.csv) page.
